[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9ufforppr67h7low/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/koliva8245/heroesparserdata/branch/master)
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/koliva8245/HeroesMatchTracker.svg)](https://github.com/koliva8245/HeroesMatchTracker/releases/latest)

This application parses Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm replay files and then saves the data into a local database.  
- Saves the data from your matches: Quick Match, Unranked Draft, Storm League, Hero League, Team League, Brawls (those that have replays), and Custom Games
- View information such as Talent choices, Score Summary, Hero Bans, Observers, Team Chat
- Also view personal statistics about your heroes: wins, losses, winrates, talent winrates and much more for different maps and gamemodes
- Includes a built-in [HotsApi](https://hotsapi.net/) uploader (automatically uploads to [HOTS Logs](https://www.hotslogs.com/Default))
- For more information, visit the [wiki](https://github.com/koliva8245/HeroesMatchTracker/wiki)
