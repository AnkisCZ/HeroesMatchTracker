This application uses [Heroes.ReplayParser](https://github.com/koliva8245/Heroes.ReplayParser) to parse Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm replay files and then saves the data into a local database.  
- Saves the data from your matches: Quick Match, Unranked Draft, Hero League, Team League, Non-Arena Brawls, and Custom Games
- View information such as Talent choices, Score Summary, Hero Bans, Observers, Team Chat
- Also view personal statistics about your heroes: wins, losses, winrates, talent winrates and much more for different maps and gamemodes
- Includes a built-in HOTS Logs uploader
